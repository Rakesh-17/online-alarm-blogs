            <li><strong>Founded:</strong> 1839, Geneva, Switzerland</li>
            <li><strong>Founders:</strong> Antoni Patek and Franciszek Czapek</li>
            <li><strong>Famous For:</strong> Grand complications, minute repeaters</li>
            <li><strong>Motto:</strong> "You never actually own a Patek Philippe. You merely look after it for the next generation."</li>

          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300">
          Patek Philippe represents the pinnacle of watchmaking artistry. Founded by Polish immigrant Antoni Patek and Czech watchmaker Franciszek Czapek, the company gained its legendary status when French horologist Adrien Philippe joined in 1845, bringing his revolutionary keyless winding and hand-setting system.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300">
          The brand has created some of the most complicated timepieces in history, including the legendary Henry Graves Supercomplication, which held the record as the world's most complicated mechanical watch for 56 years. Patek Philippe has been owned by the Stern family since 1932, maintaining its independence and commitment to horological excellence.

          <ul class="text-gray-300">
            <li><strong>Founded:</strong> 1905, London (moved to Geneva in 1919)</li>
            <li><strong>Founder:</strong> Hans Wilsdorf</li>
            <li><strong>Famous For:</strong> Submariner, Daytona, GMT-Master</li>
            <li><strong>Crown Achievement:</strong> First waterproof wristwatch (Oyster, 1926)</li>
            <li><strong>Annual Production:</strong> Approximately 1 million watches</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300">
          Hans Wilsdorf's vision was simple yet revolutionary: create a wristwatch as precise as a pocket watch but more practical for daily wear. Starting as Wilsdorf & Davis in London, the company became Rolex in 1908, a name chosen because it was easy to pronounce in any language and looked elegant on a watch dial.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300">
          Rolex pioneered numerous innovations that define modern watchmaking: the first waterproof case (Oyster), the first self-winding mechanism (Perpetual), and the first watch to display the date (Datejust). The brand's marketing genius was equally impressive, using explorers, athletes, and celebrities to demonstrate their watches' capabilities in extreme conditions.

Initially controversial, it revolutionized luxury watch design and saved the Swiss watch industry during the quartz crisis.

          IWC was founded by American engineer Florentine Ariosto Jones, who wanted to combine American industrial efficiency with Swiss craftsmanship. Located in Schaffhausen, outside traditional Swiss watchmaking regions, IWC developed a unique culture focused on engineering excellence and technical innovation.

          The brand became famous for their pilot's watches, particularly during World War II when they supplied the British Royal Air Force. The Big Pilot's Watch, with its distinctive onion crown and ultra-legible dial, became an icon of aviation timekeeping. IWC's Portuguese collection, originally created for Portuguese businessmen who wanted marine chronometer accuracy in a wristwatch, represents some of the finest dress watches ever made.

          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-gray-300">
          Panerai's story is deeply intertwined with Italian naval history. Initially a precision instruments shop in Florence, the company became the official supplier to the Royal Italian Navy's elite divers and commandos. Their watches featured revolutionary luminous material called Radiomir, later replaced by Luminor, providing exceptional visibility underwater.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300">
          For decades, Panerai watches were classified military equipment. The brand only entered the civilian market in 1993, when Richemont acquired the company. Sylvester Stallone discovered Panerai while filming "Daylight" in Italy and helped introduce the brand to American collectors, sparking the large watch trend of the 2000s.
